# django-tutorial
Following the Django Docs Tutorial 
For this I was following the [Django Getting Started](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/) up to Part 7. 
The Django tutorial shows the Django basics by creating a polls app. 
Doing this here for my reference in the future. 

## Requirements 
* Python 3
* Django (Follow the instructions from the docs) 

## In the directory where project is create a virtual environment for Python since Mac OS needs to use Python 2 for some stuff.  
```text
python3 -m venv ./venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Confirm that the the environment picks up Python 3 by running 
```text
python --version
```
From now on just run this to activate the environment whenever a new terminal shell is opened.  
```text
source .venv/bin/activate
```
